# Calculate Valuation Controller

Welcome to the Calculate Valuation Controller project, a minimalist PHP project designed for fun and non profit by Florian Kuhlmann. This project is ideal for DevOps professionals and developers looking to test and develop DevOps practices, Docker configurations, and build pipelines. With a simple controller performing calculations and accompanied by unit tests, it serves as a perfect sandbox for testing and learning.

## Project Overview

This Composer-based PHP project is small and straightforward, focusing on a single controller that performs certain calculations. It's designed with simplicity in mind to facilitate easy understanding and manipulation for DevOps experiments and learning.

### Features

- **Simple PHP Controller**: Executes basic calculations, demonstrating simple web application logic.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes tests for the application logic, facilitating Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) practices.
- **Composer Integration**: Utilizes Composer for dependency management, ensuring easy setup and standardization.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need a PHP environment and Composer installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this project to your local environment or development server.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/floriankuhlmann/calculate_valuation_controller.git

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using Composer.

    ```bash
    cd calculate_valuation_controller
    composer install

3. **Autoload Classes**: Ensure the PSR-4 autoloader is configured to autoload the project classes.

4. **Run Tests**: To verify the setup and functionality, run the included tests.
